  14:00 - 17:30 BIO | mlr for advanced
<br><br>
The “Machine learning in R” workshop on the 23. May 2018 is aimed at participants already familiar with the basics of R. The first part (~ 1 hour) will introduce participants to the basic concepts of supervised (classification / regression) and unsupervised (clustering) learning. Afterwards you will learn how to efficiently and easily apply the most common techniques in R using the comprehensive <a href="https://mlr-org.github.io/"><font color="96187d">mlr package</font></a>. Our instructor, <a href="http://jakob-r.de/"><font color="96187d">Jakob Richter</font></a> is an experienced data scientists and as a co-developer of mlr knows the ins and outs of the package. He will demonstrate some of its key features on a practical example enabling you to apply mlr on your problems to find a good pefrorming prediction model, analyze and tweaking the performance using mlrs tuning methods.<br><br>
