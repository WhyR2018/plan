    Hackathon, a collaborative work on the mlr package under the guidance of its developers.<br><br>
  mlr hackathon<br><br>

mlr Explorathon / Explainathon / Documenthon<br>

Take part at the mlr Hackathon and learn how to solve practical machine learning problems easily and elegantly with R and mlr. You will be presented a small but challenging problem that your team of up to 5 people has to solve in a reproducible way. In the sense of open science a concisely documented solution is essential to help fellow R users. mlr is a package that offers a lot to tackle the most common and not so common problems but has a steep learning curve. Present your solution and get published on the mlr website.<br>
After the hackathon we drink beer and discuss results of our work! ðŸ™‚
