  Teaching of data science

Data science, as every emerging field, requires constantly evolving set of skills. In any setting, both corporate and academic, teaching data analysis remains a challenge. During this meeting data science practitioners will share their experiences in introducing their students to basic and advanced concepts of data science. This meeting will be moderated by Leon Eyrich Jessen (Technical University of Denmark) and Stefan RÃ¶diger (Brandenburg Technical University Cottbus-Senftenberg).
