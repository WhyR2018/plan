# Dividing space - spatially constrained regionalization method for large vector GIS data.

## Description

Spatial segmentation or regionalization is a common problem in geography that in fact is an unsupervised spatially constrained clustering problem. Often, area under analysis is so complex it has to be divided into smaller subregions, that could be defined as internally homogenous, to perform further research. Such situation occurs while modeling real estate prices in a big city or  when you are planning an experiment that requires stratified sampling. Current  research concentrates on methods for segmenting raster data (usually satellite imaging or landcover data) however sometimes a need arises for understanding the structure of multidimensional data concerning diverse variables like demography, accessibility or visibility. Existing methods, in such situations, use common clustering methods like k-means or hierarchical clustering and incorporate spatial coordinates as complementary variables. Unfortunately, since the coordinates are only 2 of many variables the output regions often don’t preserve spatial continuity. Other algorithms like SKATER (Spatial 'K'luster Analysis by Tree Edge Removal) are time consuming and don’t work efficiently with very large datasets. I propose a new approach to such regionalization which uses neighborhood class as a topological structure from which a spatial network is being build. Basing on the similarity of adjacent objects, calculated from selected variables, they are being joined to their most similar community using network analysis. The proposed method combines spatial econometric and network analysis in an innovative way that expands the possibilities of spatial regionalization using point or polygon GIS data but also enhances the possibility of analyzing hierarchical structure of the subregions.
