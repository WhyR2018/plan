# Tested on Humans

[Mateusz	Otmianowski,	Pearson]()

## Description

As data scientists, we usually create data products such as dashboards not for our own use but to help others get their insights from data. A common mistake made by a beginner data scientist is to create a data product based on best data visualisation practices, and release it without testing it on target users. This often results in a product that places eye candy above usability.

This talk will show you how to can implement usability testing in your data science workflow. I’ll walk you through the process of preparing for a usability test, running it, and analysing its results. I'll illustrate some of the design principles on the example of data products developed by the Advanced Computing & Data Science Lab at Pearson. I’ll also share what worked and what didn’t work for us along the way.
