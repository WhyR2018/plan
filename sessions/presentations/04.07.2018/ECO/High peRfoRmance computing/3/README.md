# How to multiply your R computing power in 15 minutes for few bucks

[Mikołaj	Olszewski,	iDash s.c.]()

## Description

R users are often running into performance troubles while trying to perform computationally intensive calculations on large datasets. Personal computers rarely have more than few cores and 16 gigabytes of RAM. While usually a lot of optimisation can be done to fit calculations into personal machine, sometimes it’s just not enough.

One of the solutions is to buy professional hardware dedicated to perform calculations for you. This however, can be very costly and inefficient as you probably wouldn’t use the available power all the time. Additionally, you’re the one responsible for maintaining this machine, what simply cost some extra time if something breaks down.

The other option is to leverage the power of cloud computing. Setting up a powerful machine in the cloud, that can be used on demand, is now easier, quicker and cheaper than ever. In my presentation I’m going to live show how one can set up a fully functional machine running R and RStudio, having 64GB of ram and 8 cores in less than 15 minutes.
