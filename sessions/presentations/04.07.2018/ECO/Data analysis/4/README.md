## Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the areas that use machine learning methods. It is mainly used in games, but more and more often appears in everyday life. As history shows, creating an engine of artificial intelligence that will defeat a human in a chess game or Go is not a simple task. Artificial intelligence in computer games can use a simple set of rules, tree search methods or even neural networks. 
During work breaks R can be used for entertainment. There is a fun package in which we can find some simple games. The goal of the presentation is to try to implement a strategic turn-based game in R similiar to the combat system in Heroes of Might and Magic. The game will use the alpha-beta algorithm, which will be an artificial intelligence of the computer.
