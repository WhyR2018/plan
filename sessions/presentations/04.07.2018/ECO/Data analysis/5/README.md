# Get your Machine Learning workflow with under control with DVC

[Mikołaj	Bogucki,	Pearson]()

## Description

Data Version Control (DVC) is an experiment management tool that has been built to seamlessly integrates with the Git version control system. A DVC pipeline can support a data scientist in each step of the Machine Learning (ML) life cycle: from modifying ML algorithms (such as adding a new features or tuning hyperparameters) to ensuring reproducibility.

In this talk, I’d like to share my experience from using DVC in my work in the Advanced Computing and Data Science Lab at Pearson. I’ll show how to build a DVC pipeline step by step. I’ll also share my experience with building and managing the process of model development with DVC.
