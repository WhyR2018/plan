# Method Comparisons with Applications in Biomarker Research and Development

[Andre	Beinrucker,	Thermo Fisher Scientific]()

## Description

"In many areas of science, such as Chemistry, Biology or Physics, two different quantitative measurements procedures need to be assessed and compared to each other. As a simple approach, one could plot the results of the two methods in a scatterplot and draw a linear (least squares) regression line through the cloud of points. We explain in this talk, why this approach is usually not appropriate and present alternatives, such as Passing-Bablok regression and weighted Deming regression. We show how these methods are implemented in the R-package mcr (by E. Manuilova, A. Schuetzenmeister, F. Model [1]). Further, we explain how we use this R-package in the context of Biomarker research and development and point out difficulties and common misinterpretations of method comparison results. Finally, we show how method comparisons can be performed online using a freely available Shiny app by Burak Bahar [2].
