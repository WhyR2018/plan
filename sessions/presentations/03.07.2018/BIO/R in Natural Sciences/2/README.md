# R in LiFE ForBioSensing remote sensing project

## Description

  The R language is a very popular tool for acquiring, processing and analysing remote sensing (RS) data. Many packages of this language have been developed for analysis of the forest environment but also many other tools, non-dedicated to remote sensing, are used in such projects. Within the Life+ ForBioSensing project „Comprehensive monitoring of stand dynamics in Białowieża Forest supported with remote sensing techniques”, which is carried out by the Forest Research Institute, the R language is a basic tool for processing spatial data. The choice of such a method for data analysis is not accidental: in the R language there are many developed packages dedicated to processing of remote sensing and GIS analyses. At the same time, through a simple syntax R, it is easy to use by non-programmers.
  
	During the project, from 2015 up to 2019 annual large collections of remote sensing data are acquired, incl.: airborne and terrestrial laser scanning, satellite imagery, hyperspectral imagery, aerial imagery and various terrestrial measurements. Such a large database of multi temporal RS data is acquired for the first time both in Poland and in the world. The number of data and processing requires a novel approach that integrates data from multiple sources. A part of the project is to create innovative tools based on integration of R, C++ and PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. The developed methods of data integration and their analysis are innovative on a global scale.
	
	The tools and R language are used in the project to:
•	process large remote sensing data sets,
•	develop new methods of improving and controlling products,
•	determinate features of trees and stands,
•	statistical analysis and modelling, 
•	results visualization.
