## Description

Bioconductor (www.bioconductor.org) is a bioinformatics open software that provides R tools for the analysis of genomic data, including this from next-generation high-throughput sequencing methods. The aims of Bioconductor are to provide access to powerful tools for statistical and graphic methods that help visualize genomic data. The project promotes high quality documentation, repeatability of tests and a package installation system, which is partly independent from the standard R mechanism. The function provided by Bioconductor biocLite() is an overlay on install.packages(), ensuring the installation of the correct version of packages, compatible with the Bioconductor version. Based on the data posted on the official website, there are 1560 software packages and it has two releases each year. The latest version of Bioconductor is 3.7. Increasing advances in biotechnology lead to new types of data, and data sets are rapidly growing in size, resolution and diversity. RNA-seq is a next generation sequencing method that is used to quantify the amount of RNA in a biological sample at a given timepoint. This type of data can be read into R in different way, depending on the basic format. RNA-seq data stores information on transcriptome sequence and is distributed in a form of millions of reads, i.e. small files, each containing information of several nucleotide sequence. Bioconductor provides four basic packages for reading RNA-seq data easyRNASeq, ShortRead, Rsamtools and GenomicAlignments. An important step in analysing next generation sequencing data is filtering. This step is computed by easyRNASeq and allows e.g. to reject the reads that don't align to the reference genome, that have insufficient sequencing quality or that contain many unknown nucleotides. The ShortRead package provides functionality for working with FASTQ files from high throughput sequence analysis and it allows also working with BAM files. Rsamtools package provides an interface to BAM files. BAM files are produced by samtools and other software, and represent a flexible format for storing ‘short’ reads aligned to reference genomes. GenomicAlignments package serves as the foundation for representing genomic alignments within the Bioconductor project. Another important step is the genomic annotation of the reads to relate their locations to genes and other genomic features, such as gene transcriptional start sites or binding sites of other factors, such as enhancers. For this step, Bioconductor provides a couple of packages, such as biomaRt, genomeInterval, GenomicFeatures. One of the important elements of RNA-seq data analysis is its meaningful visualization. The aim of this step is to present the data and results in the most informative way. Before any statistical analysis RNA-seq data have to be normalized, the purpose of this step is to identify and remove sources of systematic variation, other than differential expression. For this step one of the popular packs is marray. Bioconductor gives a wide option of packages that allow to test differential gene expression such as  DESeq2. One of the important elements of RNA-seq data analysis is its meaningful visualization. The aim of this step is to present the data and results in the most informative way. To visualize the expression of genes, heatmaps, which allow to present gene expression levels for many samples, are increasingly being used. Bioconductor provides a special package called ComplexHeatmap. This package allows for a highly flexible way to arrange multiple heatmaps and supports self-defined annotation graphics. The availability of Bioconductor software allow for conducting an RNA-seq analysis for persons who are no professional programmers, but are biologists which can then concentrate on the proper interpretation of results.
