# Using Scrum for data science projects

[Emilia	Pankowska,	Pearson]()

## Description

This talk will show how you can implement Scrum for conducting data science projects. Scrum is a framework for solving complex problems. It makes it easier to coordinate such aspects of teamwork as designing incremental solutions while not losing the big picture, within-team and cross-team collaboration, information flow, etc. 

While these days Scrum tends to be associated with software development, I’ll show how we adopted it to our data science projects. Some of the Scrum methods may seem counter-intuitive. For example, there’s a focus on incremental deliverables, even if they’re just mockups. I’ll focus on this and other elements of Scrum that we found challenging, so that you too can use it to improve the quality and comfort of your work.
