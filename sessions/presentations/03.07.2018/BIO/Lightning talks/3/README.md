# How to prepare for a job in data science?

[Małgorzata	Schmidt,	Pearson]()

## Description

In early 2017, I enrolled in an internship at a data science team at Pearson while completing my BA in Mathematics at the Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) in Poznań. Since then I’ve continued my internship at the company but I also enrolled in an MA programme in data science at AMU. It’s the first programme available at a Polish university that’s aimed at educating the next generation of data scientists in order to meet the growing market demand.

I decided to give this talk because many colleagues asked me about which of the two paths can better prepare a person for a career in data science. If I already landed a long-term internship in a professional data science team where I learn daily on the job, then why would I need more structured learning in the academia?  In the near future, will getting an MA in data science give you a competitive edge in the market? Should you stop wasting time on internships, hackathons, or Kaggle-like competitions, and study for two more years instead? 

While there is no clear-cut answer to these questions, I’ll share my experience about the advantages and disadvantages of each path. I hope this talk provide some guidance to those who are about to start their data science career.
