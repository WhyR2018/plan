# Unnatural language processing

[Yizhar	Toren,	Shopify]()

## Description

In the twilight zone between carefully managed keywords and natural language corpuses, we find a strange species of short text strings used by our suppliers to describe the products they upload into our catalog (aka product “titles”). These short phrases (5-30 words) contain a huge amount of information about the product (and therefore seemed a good place to start mapping our catalog) but do not follow a strict structure or natural language rules. In this talk I'll describe how I used R's data & NLP tools to handle the strange nature of these creatures at scale, and how I was able to quickly prototype a mechanism that serves our recommendation & search engine and helps us understand and improve our product catalog.
