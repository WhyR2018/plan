# Making Shiny shine brighter with 6 useful packages

[Krystian	Igras]()

## Description

There is no need to praise Shiny for its influence on presenting results. As with many other technology stacks, Shiny could benefit from community contributions for further development of the package itself and the growth of independent packages that add new features.

In this presentation we will show six packages that add interesting capabilities to Shiny such as beautiful UI `shiny.semantic` and `semantic.dashboard`, routing `shiny.router`, authentication `shiny.users`, app usage monitoring `shiny.admin` and internationalization `shiny.i18n`. 

We will demo the app that uses all these packages. We  show how their usage improves working with Shiny and what their development adds to the open source community. Presented packages help companies adopt R/shiny and proves to be very useful based on the feedback for out clients.
