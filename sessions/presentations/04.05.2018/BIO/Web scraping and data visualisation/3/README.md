# Webscraping with RSelenium

[Krsteff-Jantcheff	Pieter,	Ordina Belgium]()

## Description

During the 3 years I have been working as a data scientist, it happened very rarely that I received a clean and tidy excel file with data to do analysis on. Very often all we have is a business question and we have to acquire the data from any source possible, like from the worldwide web. Therefore web scraping is a very powerful tool to have in your arsenal as a data geek.  Despite the importance of it, I feel that this skill is underrated within the data science community, which is why I want to share my web scraping experience with you and introduce to you my favorite package in R to do this: RSelenium.

RSelenium makes it possible to connect to a Remote Selenium Server from R and provides R bindings for the Selenium Webdriver API. More specifically it allows you to extract any piece of information from a web page into R in a structured and automatic way. R users are easily scared away because it involves some Java syntax. This causes them to learn other web scraping packages. This is a shame because I believe RSelenium offers more freedom and flexibility than these other packages. After this talk you will know exactly what I mean.
