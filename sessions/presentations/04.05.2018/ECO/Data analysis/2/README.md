# Using online updating algorithms to predict speedway resultsnium

[Dawid	Kałędkowski,	ClickMeeting.com]()

## Description

Sport or computer games rivalries need up-to-date estimation of players strength to suggest relevant opponent, specify risk or value bets. Online updating algorithms perform very well when data flows are continuous or sudden, saving computation capacity and processing time. Examining performance of speedway riders, several methods will be presented, explained and applied using R. You will also learn who was the best speedway rider last year, who is at the top now, and how riders abilities changes in time.

R packages: sport, Rcpp
