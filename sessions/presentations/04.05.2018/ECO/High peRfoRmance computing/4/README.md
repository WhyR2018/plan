# Tell me which packages you use and I’ll tell you who you are (tidyverse vs data.table vs base R)

[Anna	Skrzydło]()

## Description

Have you ever consciously considered which R packages you should use? If yes, then probably you’ve asked yourself such questions:

Should I use just pure base R and never be dependent on package updates? Or maybe is it worth to switch my whole code to clear tidyverse environment? Oh wait, how about taking advantage of data.table efficiency? 

With so many good options, the only right answer is – it depends… We’ve also spend some time experimenting with different combinations in our 15-person team and now have some insights to share with you.
