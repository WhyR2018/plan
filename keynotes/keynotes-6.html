The Deep Learning library TensorFlow, was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization. In 2015 Google decided to release TensorFlow as open source software for all to use. The paramount criteria for any technology to have an impact on our society is availability. With the release of TensorFlow we have seen a revolution in application of artificial intelligence within numerous areas. Early 2018 RStudio released a suite of R-packages for working with TensorFlow in R. Thereby, R-users can now tap into hitherto unavailable AI technology. Keras, a high-level TensorFlow API, enables fast experimentation - Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research. In my research I apply deep learning using Keras for R to unravel the rules governing molecular interactions in the human immune system.
