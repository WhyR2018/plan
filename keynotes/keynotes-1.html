  9:00 - 09:30 ECO | Tomasz Niedzielski: Forecasting streamflow using the HydroProg system developed in R

  The objective of the talk is to present the performance of HydroProg, which is a real-time and fully-automated system for issuing early warnings against high flows and floods. The HydroProg system is developed in R and its main task is to integrate hydrometeorological gauging networks with numerous hydrologic models in order to compute rapid prognoses of streamflow. The integration in question enables the production of multimodel ensemble predictions which are based on real-time weighting of forecasts computed by hydrologic models that are unlike each other. Two implementations of HydroProg in southwestern Poland are discussed: for the upper Nysa KÅ‚odzka river basin (mountainous case) and for the upper and middle Odra river basin (predominantly lowland case). The accuracy and skills of the system are provided, with the particular emphasis put on forecasting high flows. The external modules that can be integrated with HydroProg are also mentioned. The activities towards elaborating a complete version of the system, suitable for complementing the reliable hydrologic forecasts issued by national and international institutions, are also presented. The research is financed by the National Centre for Research and Development as well as the National Science Centre, Poland (projects no. TANGO1/267857/NCBR/2015, 2011/01/D/ST10/04171).
