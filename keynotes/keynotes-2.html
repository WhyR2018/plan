  One PhD student (physicist) comes up with an idea and shares it with the second PhD student (computer scientist). The second PhD student develops the idea and together they create an innovative method. The method turns out to be competitive compared to the available ones. Finally, it is bought by a private investor who sets up the company and prepares the method for sale. Story like many others? Probably yes, but this one uses R to identify the bacterial species based on the diffractograms of the bacterial colonies from the very first idea to MVP, and final product.
