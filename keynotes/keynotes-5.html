  The world around us and the subjects we are working with are in permanent motion. Such time-dependent systems are called "dynamical", they change, move, develop, break down or evolve. Dynamic models aim to simulate this movement in the computer, either with discrete time steps or with differential equations to get a continuous time series. Unfortunately, only few differential equation models can be integrated analytically, while the more complex require a numerical simulation software. <br>
Dynamical simulations produce plenty of data. Their analysis was indeed one of my strongest motivations to start with R, a few years before the first useR conference. Around 100 add-on packages existed at that time, one of them 'odesolve' [1] with the 'lsoda' differential equation solver. I was very excited, planned to use it for an upcoming workshop about ecological modeling, but then missed an urgently needed feature, just one week before the workshop. I looked in the source code and got in contact with the package developer, Woodrow Setzer. The problem was quickly solved and then R took over and replaced almost all of our modeling tools - and our productivity increased.
In 2009, Karline Soetaert's first book appeared [2], a kind of book that I had been really waiting for. She brought R's dynamic modelers toolbox a tremendous step forward by implementing a full set of solvers, by making them more user-friendly, and by contributing great examples, companion packages and comprehensive documentation. Having been invited to contribute to this team [3] was a great experience and it is still a pleasure to me.<br><br>
I will present essentials of R's dynamic modeling ecosystem that evolved since then:<br>
-	essentials of core package 'deSolve', its solvers and extensions that make them convenient,<br>
-	the way, how to speed up ordinary and partial differential equation models by using matrix algebra and compiled C or Fortran code,<br>
-	package 'rodeo' [4] for generating Fortran code on the fly from Excel tables,<br>
-	a demonstration how to embed dynamic simulations in web-pages with 'shiny' [5].<br><br>
The power and versatility of the approach will be demonstrated by small teaching examples and two more complex research applications.
