  9:00 - 12:00 | 13:30-17:00 Analiza i wizualizacja danych w R! - R-Ladies Warsaw
<br><br>
Interesujesz się analizą danych?
Znasz podstawy programowania?
Miałeś styczność z R i RStudio?

Jeśli na wszystkie pytania Twoja odpowiedź brzmi “tak!”, to zapraszamy Cię do udziału w naszych warsztatach z analizy i wizualizacji danych w R! W czasie warsztatów nauczysz się jak w szybki i czytelny sposób przetwarzać dane m.in. przy pomocy pakietu dplyr oraz jak prezentować je w formie wykresów (również interaktywnych!) używając bibliotek ggplot2 i plotly.

Zapraszamy również panów! :)

Warsztaty będą podzielone na cztery półtoragodzinne bloki:
1. podstawowe przetwarzanie danych (m.in. dplyr)
2. podstawowa wizualizacja danych (m.in. ggplot2)
3. zaawansowane przetwarzanie danych (m.in. dplyr, tidyr)
4. zaawansowana wizualizacja danych (m.in. ggplot2, plotly)

  9:00 - 12:00 | 13:30-17:00 Constructing scales from survey questions - Tomasz	Żółtak, Educational Research Institute (Warsaw, Poland)
<br><br>
Surveys often include sets of questions on the same subject, designed to create more general indicators of views, attitudes, knowledge or other characteristics of respondents. Such an indicators allow for synthesis of information, drawing more general conclusions and reduction of random measurement errors. As continuous variables, they are also easier to use in further analysis.

However, the use of survey questions often involves a number of problems:
- answers are given on scales that can’t be treated as continuous (eg. a Likert scale);
- response to the questions may depend on the way in which they are worded, eg. respondents may react a little different to negative statements;
- respondents may have different styles of answering questions, eg. some may prefer more extreme answers than the other;
- in self-assessment questionnaires some respondents may be inclined to give untruthfully answers indicating a higher level of knowledge or skills.

Workshop participants will learn how to use R to:
- create scales based on sets of categorical variables using Categorical Exploratory/Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CEFA / CCFA) and IRT models;
- use models with bi-factor rotation to deal with different forms of asking questions;
- correct for differences in a style of answering questions asked using a Likert scale;
- use the possibility to correct self-assessment knowledge/skill indicators using fake items.

During the workshop R packages ‘polycor’, ‘mirt’ and ‘laavan’ will be used along with the data from international surveys: ESS, PISA and PIAAC.

  9:00 - 12:00 | 13:30-17:00 From RS data to knowledge – Remote Sensing in R - Bartłomiej	Kraszewski,	Forest Research Institute
<br><br>
Remote sensing data from different sensors is a rich source of information for studying the natural environment, natural phenomena and monitoring some extreme phenomena, i.e. floods. Analyses and products made on remote sensing data are often essential for supporting decision-making processes in cities, forests and agriculture. Analyses of RS data are carried out for large areas which amounts to the use of advanced tools for their processing, i.e. databases or programming languages. For this type of analyses the R language is used more and more often. Its tools inventory in this area is still growing. R packages can be used for data analysis, processing and visualization.
The workshop aim is to present R language packages that can be used to work with remote sensing data. During the course packages for GIS analysis (rgdal, rgeos, sf), raster data processing (raster) and ALS data processing (lidR) will be used. The possibility of mutual data integration will be presented in order to obtain new information for later analyses and modelling using machine learning. The entire workshop will be carried out as a simple project of remote sensing data analysis in the forest environment. During the workshop lecturers will put emphasis on the practical use of R packages, which they usually use in their daily work in large remote sensing projects (LIFE ForBioSensing and RemBioFor) carried out by the Forest Research Institute in Sękocin Stary.

  9:00 - 12:00 | 13:30-17:00 DALEX: Descriptive mAchine Learning EXplanations . Tools for exploration, validation and explanation of complex machine learning models - Mateusz	Staniak,	Uniwersytet Wrocławski
<br><br>
Complex machine learning models are frequently used in predictive modeling. There are a lot of examples for random forest like or boosting like models in medicine, finance, agriculture etc.

In this workshop we will show why and how one would analyze the structure of the black-box model.

This will be a hands-on workshop with four parts. In each part there will be a short lecture  and then time for practice and discussion.  Find the description for each part below.

1. Introduction
Here we will show what problems may arise from blind application of black-box models. Also we will show situations in which the understanding of a model structure leads to model improvements, model stability and larger trust in the model.
During the hands-on part we will fit few complex models (like xgboost, randomForest) with the mlr package and discuss basic diagnostic tools for these models.

2. Conditional Explainers
In this part we will introduce techniques for understanding of marginal/conditional response of a model given a one- two- variables. We will cover PDP (Partial Dependence Plots) and ICE (Individual Conditional Expectations) packages for continuous variables and MPP (Merging Path Plot from factorMerger package) for categorical variables.

4. Local Explainers
In this part we will introduce techniques that explain key factors that drive single model predictions. This covers Break Down plots for linear models (lm / glm) and tree-based models (randomForestExplainer, xgboostExplainer) along with model agnostic approaches implemented in the live package (an extension of the LIME method).

5. Global Explainers
In this part we will introduce tools for global analysis of the black-box model, like variable importance plots, interaction importance plots and tools for model diagnostic.

Packages that we will use include  mlr (Bernd Bischl and others), DALEX (Przemysław Biecek),  live (Staniak Mateusz, and Przemysław Biecek), FactorMerger(Sitko Agnieszka, and Przemyslaw Biecek),  pdp (Greenwell, Brandon),  ALEPlot (Apley, Dan).

  9:00 - 12:00 | 13:30-17:00 Responding to analysis and communication: Data science the R way - Tatjana	Kecojevic,	DataTeka
<br><br>
You have heard about R and would like to learn and see what it does and how it works? Then you should come to our workshop. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of R and you will get to know how to use its tools needed in a typical data science project. We will introduce you to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After we develop an understanding of our data we will use R’s reproducible and interactive approach in telling our data story by creating reproducible R-Markdown documents and Shiny Web Apps. You should bring a laptop with latest version of R and RStudio installed. All the material will be available for download.
