  9:00 - 12:30 Micha≈Ç Maj, Appsilon Data Science: Introduction to Deep Learning with Keras in R
<br><br>
With the release of the R Keras package (https://keras.rstudio.com/) (by JJ Allaire and Francois Chollet) at the end of 2017 / beginning 2018 the topic of artificial neural networks and especially deep learning in R became red-hot within the R community.<br><br>

In this workshop you will get answers for the following questions:<br><br>

What are fully conected and convolutional neural networks ?<br>
How to build a sequential model in Keras (keras_model_sequential() function) ?<br>
How to compile and fit naural netwrks in Keras (compile() and fit() functions) ?<br>
How to add regularization to neural networks (L1, L2, dropout) ?<br>
How to save and load existing models ?<br>
How to perform data ingestion and augmentation using generators ?<br>
How to use pre-trained models and perform fine-tuning ?<br>
How to use callbacks ?<br><br>

Please make sure to bring your laptop including an up to date R version, RStudio and install Keras:<br>

Setup Keras (Make sure to install required prerequisites, before installing Keras using the commands below)<br>

install_keras() # CPU version <br>
# install_keras(tensorflow = "gpu") # GPU version (recommended)<br>
