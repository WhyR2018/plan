  13:30-17:00 Roman Popat, Jumping Rivers: Jumping Rivers - Advanced Shiny
<br><br>
This workshop would suit attendees who are already comfortable with creating shiny applications. We will explore how to add functionality to our app using javascript packages and code. No real javascript knowledge is required to get started if you are a confident R programmer but the session will contain examples with written javascript. We will then explore how one might deal with routines in a shiny application that take a long time to run, or how to provide a good experience for simultaneous users of your app. We will then explore creating a standalone web served API to our R code and integrate the use of it into a shiny application.<br><br>
