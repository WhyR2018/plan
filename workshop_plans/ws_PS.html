Creating spatial data visualization is one of the coolest elements in the R toolbox. <br>
In the workshop I shall show you tips to follow, pitfalls to avoid and hacks that might be either one of them :) Starting from a basic plot function, we will cover ggplot2 and finish with R packages that use interactive javascript libraries. You will get familiar with the full process from finding the right data, its processing in R up to preparing final data to plot.
<br> 
   Please install the following packages: 'dplyr', 'tidyr', 'sf', 'ggplot2', 'ggmap', 'ggthemes', 'animation', 'leaflet', 'rnaturalearth'
